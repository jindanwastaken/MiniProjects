A python script that will scrape every student (only works for CUSAT) results and outputs it into a csv file 

## How to use
Download the file `scrape.py` and `chromedriver.exe` and place it in the directory where the organising needs to be done.

Run the script and voila! Your job is done.

### Usage 
```
python scrape.py
```

__Note:__ `chromedriver.exe` is to be placed within the __same__ directory as `File_Organiser.py`.
